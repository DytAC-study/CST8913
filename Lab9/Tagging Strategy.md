# Tagging Strategy

Implementing a robust tagging strategy is essential for cloud resource management. Beyond the basic tags like **Environment** and **Department**, additional tags can provide better management and control over cloud resources.

Below is one possible strategy to identify cloud resources:

| Tag name     | Value | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Environment  | Test  | Defines the environment this resource is deployed.           |
| Department   | IT    | Defines who or which department this resource belongs to.    |
| Project      | Alpha | Links resources to a particular project or initiative.       |
| ServiceClass | Gold  | Defines the service level or performance tier of the resource. |
| Backup       | Daily | Specifies the backup schedule or policy for the resource.    |

Implementing these additional tags, along with adhering to best practices, will enhance resource management, cost tracking, and operational efficiency in your cloud environment.
